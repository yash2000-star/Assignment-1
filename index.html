        <p>This category has evolved a lot since I first explored it last year. Now you'll find powerful options that'll help you write emails, improve communication, sort through conversations, or burn a stack of junk mail in a flash. This is a lot more compared with the first-wave AI email apps that just integrated with OpenAI for writing drafts and called it a day.
            I spent two weeks researching and testing the best AI email assistants, and I've put together a shortlist for you to try outâ€”along with apps you should keep an eye on. And in case you'd like to build your own AI-powered email workflows, I've included a quick breakdown of how this technology can help you do just that.</p>
